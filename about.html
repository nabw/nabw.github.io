I am chilean, and very proud of it! In case you were in doubt: yes, you should visit Chile, we have all weathers so you will probably find something to suit your needs. We do have tropical weather in what I believe to be our biggest marketing failure: Easter island.
</p>

<p>
My higher education started at Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacutelica de Chile, where I got my Bachelor and M.Sc. in Engineering Sciences, together with a professional degree in Industrial Engineering, diploma in Mathematics. During the master, I had the fortune of working with Daniel Hurtado and Gabriel Gatica on image registration. Then I got my Ph.D. in Italy, at Politecnico di Milano. I was part of a big research group under a project (iHeart) where I met fantastic people. I worked mainly with Paolo Zunino, and also with Luca Dede' and Alfio Quarteroni on cardiac poromechanics. I then changed a bit my focus during my first year of post-doc at the University of Milan, where I worked with Simone Scacchi on the development of scalable domain decomposition preconditioners, with cardiac mechanics being our target physics. I continued this work, and extended it to electrophysiology and nonlinear solvers in general at the University of Pavia with Luca Pavarino. I did a small period of post-doc at CMM in Chile, where I worked with Axel Osses in the development of a liquid crystal model for cardiac fibers, and now I am back at PUC for the devlopment of oxygen delivery models in soft tissues. </p>

<p>If any of this captures even a tiny bit of your attention, most of my work is freely available online, so check the Research and Coding pages on this site, and also contact me! I will be very happy if we can work together on something.

<p>I am quite the advocate of open source, which refers to all software that makes its source code available. This gets translated into the following choices: </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Windows/MacOSS &rarr; Linux, BSD </li>
	<li>Android/iOS &rarr; Lineage OS, /e/ (Murena), Plasma, Phosh</li>
	<li>Matlab &rarr; Octave</li>
	<li>COMSOL, Abaqus &rarr; (FEniCS || Firedrake || deal.II) + Gmsh</li>
	<li>Microsoft Offige &rarr; Free Office, Libre Office, Open Office, LaTeX</li>
	<li>GMail &rarr; Email (/e/), Protonmail, Tutanota</li>
	<li>Google Chrome &rarr; Brave, Tor, Vivaldi</li>
	<li>Google (search) &rarr; Qwant, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search</li>
	<li>Social Networks &rarr; SlimSocial, Barinsta, Mastodon, PixelFed</li>
	<li>Cloud storage (Dropbox) &rarr; Self-hosted storage (i.e. Nextcloud)</li>
        <li> GitHub, BitBucket &rarr; Gitlab, Codeberg</li>
      </ul>
<p>I strongly encourage people to choose such software whenever possible. There are two motivations for this: the first one is ethical. If you own something, you should be able to see what it has, right? You own your house, so you get its blueprints. You own your boiler, so you can disassemble it. With software it is usually not that way, except for open source software of course. The second aspect is environmental, as Linux is a potentially much lighter operating system that has been able to do what most people expect form a computer for the last 20 years. In addition, computers are capable of yielding such services since the dawn of the 20th century, so perhaps PC production should really slow down.</p>

<p> Slowing down prodution, and in general technological austerity, is something we should embrace as the earth's resources are finite, and the extraction is taking a heavy toll on it, but for this you can google on the impacts of technology production and disposal. For more info, you can start looking at the EEB (European Environmental Boureau), specifically <a href="https://eeb.org/library/coolproducts-report/">here</a>.</p>
