I am chilean, and in case you were in doubt: yes, you should visit Chile, we have all weathers so you will probably find something to suit your needs. We do have tropical weather in what I believe to be our biggest marketing failure: Easter island.
</p>

My higher education started at Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacutelica de Chile, where I got my Bachelor and M.Sc. in Engineering Sciences, together with a professional degree in Industrial Engineering, diploma in Mathematics. During the master, I had the fortune of working with Daniel Hurtado and Gabriel Gatica on image registration. Then I got my Ph.D. in Italy, at Politecnico di Milano. I was part of a big research group under a project (iHeart) where I met fantastic people. I worked mainly with Paolo Zunino, and also with Luca Dede' and Alfio Quarteroni on cardiac poromechanics. I then changed a bit my focus during my first year of post-doc at the University of Milan, where I worked with Simone Scacchi on the development of scalable domain decomposition preconditioners, with cardiac mechanics being our target physics. I continued this work, and extended it to electrophysiology and nonlinear solvers in general at the University of Pavia with Luca Pavarino. I did a small period of post-doc at CMM in Chile, where I worked with Axel Osses in the development of a liquid crystal model for cardiac fibers, and now I am back at PUC for the devlopment of oxygen delivery models in soft tissues with Daniel Hurtado. </p>

<p>If any of this captures even a tiny bit of your attention, most of my work is freely available online, so check the Research and Coding pages on this site, and also feel free to contact me! I will be very happy to see my work arise the curiosity of other people.

<p>I am an advocate of open source, which refers to all software that makes its source code available. Here are some alternatives to standard software: </p>
      <ul>
	<li>Windows/MacOSS &rarr; Linux, BSD </li>
	<li>Android/iOS &rarr; Lineage OS, /e/ (Murena), Plasma, Phosh </li>
	<li>Matlab &rarr; Octave </li>
	<li>COMSOL, Abaqus &rarr; (FEniCS || Firedrake || deal.II) + Gmsh, NGSolve </li>
	<li>Microsoft Offige &rarr; Free Office, Libre Office, Open Office, LaTeX, Pandoc </li>
	<li>GMail &rarr; Email (/e/), Protonmail, Tutanota </li>
	<li>Google Chrome &rarr; Firefox, Brave, Tor, Vivaldi </li>
	<li>Google (search) &rarr; Qwant, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search </li>
	<li>Social Networks &rarr; SlimSocial, Barinsta, Mastodon, PixelFed </li>
	<li>Cloud storage (Dropbox) &rarr; Self-hosted storage (i.e. Nextcloud) </li>
        <li> GitHub, BitBucket &rarr; Gitlab, Codeberg </li>
	<li> Unity &rarr; Godot </li>
      </ul>
<p>I strongly encourage people to choose such software whenever possible. There are two motivations for this: the first one is ethical. If you own something, you should be able to see what it has. You own your house, so you get its blueprints. You own your boiler, so you can disassemble it. With software it is usually not that way. The second aspect is environmental, as Linux is a much lighter operating system that has been able to do what most people expect form a computer for the last 20 years. Computers are capable of yielding such services since the dawn of the 20th century, so perhaps PC production should really slow down. </p>
