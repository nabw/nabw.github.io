I am a researcher in applied maths from Chile. I work on numerical analysis and numerical methods for PDEs, and my main applications of interest regard biomedicine, mainly computational cardiology. 
</p>

<p>
    My higher education started at Pontificia Universidad Cat&oacutelica de Chile, where I got my Bachelor, professional degree in Industrial Engineering with diploma in Mathematics and M.Sc. in Engineering Sciences. During the master, I had the fortune of working with Daniel Hurtado and Gabriel Gatica on image registration. I got my Ph.D. in Italy, at Politecnico di Milano, where I was part of a big research within the iHeart project, whose PI was Alfio Quarteroni. I worked mainly with Paolo Zunino, and also with Luca Dede' and Alfio Quarteroni on cardiac poromechanics. 
</p>

<p>
    During my first year of post-doc at the University of Milan, I worked with Simone Scacchi on the development of scalable domain decomposition preconditioners, with cardiac mechanics being our target physics. I continued this work, and extended it to electrophysiology and nonlinear solvers in general at the University of Pavia with Luca Pavarino. I did a small period of post-doc at CMM in Chile, where I worked with Axel Osses in the development of a liquid crystal model for cardiac fibers, and then went back to PUC for the devlopment of oxygen delivery models in soft tissues with Daniel Hurtado. I am currently a CMM-CNRS research fellow at CMM and Assistant Professor at PUC.

<p>If any of this captures even a tiny bit of your attention, most of my work is freely available online, so check the Research and Coding pages on this site, and also feel free to contact me! I will be very happy to see my work capture the curiosity of other people.
</p>


<p>I am an advocate of open source, which refers to all software that makes its source code available. There are many arguments for using it, which I will not get into here. Still, here are some alternatives to standard software which you might be curious to try out: </p>
    <ul>
	<li>Windows/MacOS &rarr; Linux, (Free/Open)BSD </li>
	<li>Android/iOS &rarr; Lineage OS, /e/ (Murena), Plasma, Phosh, Mobian </li>
	<li>Matlab &rarr; Octave </li>
	<li>COMSOL, Abaqus &rarr; (FEniCS || Firedrake || deal.II || MFEM) + Gmsh, NGSolve, Gridap, Ferrite </li>
	<li>Microsoft Offige &rarr; Free Office, Libre Office, Open Office, Collabora, LaTeX, Pandoc, Pandas </li>
	<li>GMail &rarr; Email (/e/), Protonmail, Tutanota </li>
	<li>Google Chrome &rarr; Firefox, Brave, Tor, Vivaldi </li>
	<li>Google (search) &rarr; Qwant, DuckDuckGo, Brave Search </li>
	<li>Social Networks &rarr; SlimSocial, Barinsta, Mastodon, PixelFed </li>
	<li>Cloud storage (Dropbox) &rarr; Self-hosted storage (i.e. Nextcloud) </li>
    <li>GitHub, BitBucket &rarr; Gitlab, Codeberg, Sourcehut </li>
	<li>Unity &rarr; Godot </li>
    </ul>

<p> My setup consists of the following: Pop OS, vim, lots of git. It could surely be better and more efficient, but it works.  </p>

<p>I would like to fully acknowledge my collaborators for helping with my work. I will never say it enough, but your help has been precious for both my career and my mental health.
